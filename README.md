# Harmonicon

An interactive music theory tool for exploring the relationships between notes and chords. Inspired by [Hooktheory](https://www.hooktheory.com/) and [David Bennett Piano](https://www.youtube.com/@DavidBennettPiano).

The goal is to provide a visually engaging way to see harmonic relationships, aiding memorization, playing by ear, and brainstorming song ideas.
