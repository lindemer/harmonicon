# Harmonicon MIDI

Use your computer keyboard as a powerful key-aware MIDI controller or explore music theory using an external MIDI piano.

Inspired by the excellent educational material from [Hooktheory](https://www.hooktheory.com/) and [David Bennett Piano](https://www.youtube.com/@DavidBennettPiano).
